intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a cognitive neuroscientist, interested in how we represent future states and how future expectations shape our present experiences. 
    Specifically, how are we able to think of a time point that never occured before, and how do these imagined future states influence our current thoughts and behavior? <br>
    
    I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Laboratory of Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience, led by [Dr. Josef Parvizi](https://med.stanford.edu/parvizi-lab/people.html) @Stanford. 
    I combine intracranial recordings with behavioral paradigms to investigate how expectations about people modulate face perception over time. 
    During my PhD training, I spearheaded a large scale fMRI dataset project and [examined the relationship between expectations and pain processing](https://2023.ccneuro.org/proceedings/0001075.pdf) at the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab advised by [Tor Wager](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/tor-wager) and co-advised by [McKell Carter](https://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/r-mckell-carter).
    I'm also broadly interested in macroscale neural dynamics across various cognitive processes, particularly in how these processes converge to give rise to novel, complex cognitive functions (I illustrate it here in [my review paper](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/34/3/381/108892/Novel-Cognitive-Functions-Arise-at-the-Convergence)).
