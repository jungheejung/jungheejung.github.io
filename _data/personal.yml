intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a graduate student in the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab. My advisors are [Tor Wager]() and [McKell Carter]().
    I'm interested in macroscale dynamics across different cognitive processes. Among my current projects are a large-scale neuroimaging dataset that I led and a project that explores expectancy effects in various domains, with a particular emphasis on placebo effects and their underlying mechanisms.
