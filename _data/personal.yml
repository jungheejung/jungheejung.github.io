intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a graduate student in the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab advised by [Tor Wager](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/tor-wager) and co-advised by [McKell Carter](https://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/r-mckell-carter).
    I'm interested in macroscale dynamics in various cognitive processes and how different processes converge. 
    My ongoing projects include managing a comprehensive neuroimaging dataset, which I spearheaded, and an fMRI study focused on expectancy effects across domains, with a particular focus on placebo effects and their underlying mechanisms.
