intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a cognitive neuroscientist, investigating expectations and future states. 
    Specifically, I'm interested in how we represent future states. How can we think of a timepoint that never occured before, and how do these imagined future states influence our current thoughts and behavior? <br>
    
    As a postdoc at [Dr. Josef Parvizi](https://med.stanford.edu/parvizi-lab/people.html)'s lab @Stanford, 
    I link intracranial neural activity with behavioral paradigms and investigate how expectations modulate face perception. 
    During my PhD training, I spearheaded a [large scale fMRI dataset project](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-05154-x) and [examined the relationship between expectations and pain processing](https://2023.ccneuro.org/proceedings/0001075.pdf) at the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab advised by [Dr. Tor Wager](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/tor-wager) and co-advised by [Dr. McKell Carter](https://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/r-mckell-carter).
    I'm also interested in macroscale neural dynamics across various cognitive states. I specifically dive into how these processes converge, eventually giving rise to novel, complex cognitive functions (illusrated here in [my review paper](https://direct.mit.edu/jocn/article/34/3/381/108892/Novel-Cognitive-Functions-Arise-at-the-Convergence)).
