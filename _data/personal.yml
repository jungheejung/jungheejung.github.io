intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a graduate student in the Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab advised by [Tor Wager](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/tor-wager) and co-advised by [McKell Carter](https://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/r-mckell-carter).
    I'm interested in macroscale dynamics across different cognitive processes. Among my current projects are a maintaining a large-scale neuroimaging dataset that I led and a fMRI project that explores expectancy effects in various domains, with a particular emphasis on placebo effects and their underlying mechanisms.
