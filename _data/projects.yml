- name: "Neural correlates of expectantions across multiple domains"
  description: >
    Expectations can shape experiences. For example, one may find a shot to be more painful just because the doctor said so, or find the midterm to be easy due to a friend's headsup on the difficulty 
    Here, I investigate how expectation shape experiences of across multiple domains of Somatic pain, Vicarious pain, and Cognitive effort. 
    Check out my analysis notebook - please note that this is not production level, but just a display of my current analyses for reproducibility and documentation [Cue-expectancy bookdown](https://jungheejung.github.io/cue_expectancy)

- name: "BIDS-ifying and analyzing skin conductance response"
  description: >
    This is a repository that converts raw physiological data, collected from Acknowledge Biopac system, into BIDS compatible tsv files. It identifies boundaries between runs and splits them into separate runs. This tool box also extract event files based on TTL signals and digital channel toggles.
    This is work in collaboration with Isabel Neumann - check out our walkthrough here [Google Colab](https://github.com/spatialtopology/spacetop-prep/blob/master/spacetop_prep/physio/walkthrough_p01_grouplevel.ipynb)

- name: "A python library for preprocessing everything in my dataset"
  description: >
    For reproducibility purposes, I keep track of my code that was developed during the preprocessing stage. 
    This includes mriqc, fmriprep, but also custom-made code, such as plotting the voxel wise correlations across runs, and identifying the least similar runs within a participant.
    Other code includes behavioral data organization and questionnaire database maintenance. 
    The intention is that, by the time the dataset is published and opensource, others can utilize these codes.

- name: "Published code for data collection"
  description: >
    Reproducibility starts from the genesis: data collection. I made sure that all code was frozen and packaged prior to data collection.
    Each repository, e.g. task-faces, task-narratives, is a standalone repository, time-stamped at the time of data collection launch.
