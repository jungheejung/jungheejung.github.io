- name: "Neural correlates of expectantions across multiple domains"
  description: >
    Expectations can shape experiences. Perceiving a shot as more painful if warned 
    by a doctor, or finding a midterm easy after a friend's heads-up are everyday examples. 
    I investigate how expectations affect experiences of across multiple domains of 
    somatic pain, vicarious pain, and cognitive effort.

- name: "BIDS-ifying and analyzing skin conductance response"
  description: >
    This is a repository that converts raw physiological data, 
    collected from Acknowledge Biopac system, into BIDS compatible tsv files. 
    It identifies boundaries between runs and splits them into separate runs. 
    This tool box also extract event files based on TTL signals and digital channel toggles.

    This is work in collaboration with Isabel Neumann - check out our walkthrough here → [Physio Walkthrough Google Colab](https://github.com/spatialtopology/spacetop-prep/blob/master/spacetop_prep/physio/walkthrough_p01_grouplevel.ipynb)

- name: "A python library for preprocessing everything in my dataset"
  description: >
    For reproducibility purposes, I keep track of my preprocessing code for any quality control step. 
    This includes mriqc, fmriprep, but also custom-made code, such as plotting the voxel wise correlations across runs.
    This extends to organizing behavioral data and maintaining questionnaire databases.
    The goal is to provide a comprehensive, open-source codebase alongside the opensource dataset for others to use.

- name: "Published code for data collection"
  description: >
    Reproducibility is fundamental and begins at the very outset with data collection. 
    To ensure this, I meticulously froze and packaged all code before initiating data collection.
    Each distinct repository, like 'task-faces' and 'task-narratives', is time-stamped at data collection launch
