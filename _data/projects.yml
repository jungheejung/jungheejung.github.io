    My Ph.D. thesis explores the use of contextual information in personal informatics systems to help users understand the factors that affect their behavior. 
    Most personal informatics systems only show one type of behavioral information, which makes it difficult to discover the factors that affect one's behavior. 
    Supporting exploration of multiple types of contextual and behavioral information in a single interface may help.

    This is a repository that converts raw physiological data, collected from Acknowledge Biopac system, into BIDS compatible tsv files. It identifies boundaries between runs and splits them into separate runs. This tool box also extract event files based on TTL signals and digital channel toggles.
    This is work in collaboration with Isabel Neumann - check out our walkthrough here [Google Colab](https://github.com/spatialtopology/spacetop-prep/blob/master/spacetop_prep/physio/walkthrough_p01_grouplevel.ipynb)

    IMPACT, Improving and Motivating Physical Activity using ContexT, is a system that monitors and informs users about their physical activity and the context in which the activities happen. 
    The system shows real-time information on a phone interface and historical information on a desktop and online interface. 
    By contextualizing physical activity, the system increases users' awareness of their physical activity.
