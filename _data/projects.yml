    My Ph.D. thesis explores the use of contextual information in personal informatics systems to help users understand the factors that affect their behavior. 
    Most personal informatics systems only show one type of behavioral information, which makes it difficult to discover the factors that affect one's behavior. 
    Supporting exploration of multiple types of contextual and behavioral information in a single interface may help.

    This is a model of personal informatics systems that we hope would be valuable for research and development. 
    It provides a common framework for describing, comparing, and evaluating the growing number of this class of systems. 
    This model is composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action). 
    These stages have four properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; 
    they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted.

    IMPACT, Improving and Motivating Physical Activity using ContexT, is a system that monitors and informs users about their physical activity and the context in which the activities happen. 
    The system shows real-time information on a phone interface and historical information on a desktop and online interface. 
    By contextualizing physical activity, the system increases users' awareness of their physical activity.
